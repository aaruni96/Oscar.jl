    This function calculates the monomial basis M_{hw} recursively. The recursion saves all computed results in calc_hw and we first check, if we already
    encountered this highest weight in a prior step. If this is not the case, we need to perform computations. The recursion works by using the
    Minkowski-sum. If M_{hw} is the desired set of monomials (identified by the exponents as lattice points), it is know that for lambda_1 + lambda_2 = hw
    we have M_{lambda_1} + M_{lambda_2} subseteq M_{hw}. The complexity grows exponentially in the size of hw. Therefore, it is very helpful to obtain
    a part of M_{hw} by going through all partitions of hw and using the Minkowski-property. The base cases of the recursion are the fundamental weights
    hw = [0, ..., 1, ..., 0]. In this case, or if the Minkowski-property did not find enough monomials, we need to perform the computations "by hand".
